# Handover Report: Dependency Analysis

## Summary

This report details the results of running `pnpm install` on the project. The command completed successfully, but several issues were identified that require attention. These include peer dependency conflicts, deprecated packages, and ignored build scripts.

## Peer Dependency Conflicts

The most significant issue is a series of peer dependency conflicts related to React. Many of the project's dependencies are not yet compatible with React 19, which is used in this project. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

**Affected Packages:**

*   `leva`
*   `@radix-ui/react-portal`
*   `@radix-ui/react-primitive`
*   `@radix-ui/react-slot`
*   `@radix-ui/react-compose-refs`
*   `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`
*   `@radix-ui/react-id`
*   `@radix-ui/react-use-layout-effect`
*   `@radix-ui/react-popper`
*   `@radix-ui/react-arrow`
*   `@radix-ui/react-context`
*   `@radix-ui/react-use-rect`
*   `@radix-ui/react-use-size`
*   `@radix-ui/react-use-callback-ref`
*   `@radix-ui/react-presence`
*   `@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden`
*   `@radix-ui/react-use-controllable-state`
*   `@radix-ui/react-dismissable-layer`
*   `@radix-ui/react-use-escape-keydown`
*   `r3f-perf`
*   `@react-three/drei`
*   `react-composer`
*   `@react-spring/three`
*   `@react-spring/shared`
*   `@react-spring/animated`
*   `@react-spring/core`
*   `vaul`

## Deprecated Subdependencies

The following subdependencies are deprecated and should be updated:

*   `glob @7.2.3`
*   `inflight @1.0.6`
*   `rimraf @3.0.2`
*   `three-mesh-bvh @0.7.8`

## Ignored Build Scripts

The following build scripts were ignored by pnpm:

*   `@tailwindcss/oxide`
*   `sharp`

This is a security feature of pnpm. If these build scripts are necessary for the project to function correctly, they need to be explicitly approved by running `pnpm approve-builds`.

## Recommendations

1.  **Address Peer Dependencies:** The React 19 compatibility issues are the most critical. The best course of action is to check for updates for the affected packages that add support for React 19. If updates are not available, you may need to find alternative packages or downgrade React to version 18.
2.  **Update Deprecated Packages:** The deprecated subdependencies should be updated to their latest non-deprecated versions. This can usually be achieved by updating the parent dependencies.
3.  **Review Ignored Build Scripts:** Determine if the ignored build scripts are necessary. If they are, run `pnpm approve-builds` to allow them to execute.
